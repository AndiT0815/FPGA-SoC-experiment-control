#Cora-Z7-07S with buffer board v1.4 modified for Innsbruck.
# firmare from 15/5/2024 by Andi

#optional information printed by FPGA-init at boot.
info=Cora-Z7-07S v1.4 (IBK) primary 192.168.1.140

#IP=device static IPv4 address. default = 192.168.1.140
IP=192.168.1.140

#optional server port where server listens. default = 49701.
#port=49701

#optional entries strobe_0 and strobe_1: default = 3:4:3:1.
#give as r0:r1:r2:level. with relative ratios with respect to r0+r1+r2=1/bus output frequency.
#level = 1 or 2 = active high or toggle. 
#if level 1 then strobe is high from r0 to r1, if 2 then toggles state at r0.
#might be overwritten by software.
#strobe_0=4:40:56:2 # toggle trigger with optocoupler buffer board
# 30:40:30:1 = 300ns + 400ns + 300ns for 1us clock period
# the optional strobe_1 does not exist on this board
strobe_0=30:40:30:1

#optional specification of primary (1) or secondary (2) board. default = 2.
primary=1

#optional number of CPUs must be 1=Cora-Z7-07S or 2=Cora-Z7-10. default = 2.
#has only a small impact during uploading of data from PC to board.
CPUs=1

#optional waiting time before data is generated. primary=0, secondary=6 (typically). default = 0.
#might be overwritten by software.
wait=0

#optional synchronization phase as hex number. primary=0, secondary=0x1c308c (typically). default = 0.
#consists of {phase_ext[11:0],phase_det[11:0]}
#each phase = 0..560 steps = 0..360 degree = 18ps/step (10ns/560)
#upper 12bits = external clock phase, use to fine-adjust synchronization time
#lower 12bits = detection phase, use to select low-jitter trigger window, does not affect synchronization. (typically 90 degree = 140 = 0x8c)
#phase=0x1c308c
