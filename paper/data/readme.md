# data and analysis

Here all experimental data of the paper can be found together with the python analysis which is generating all data figures 4-6 and 8-10.

Python 3.6 was used for the analysis, but any version of Python 3 should work. 
Additional (non-default) modules used are: matplotlib, numpy, scipy. 

This data is available also on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/5145980).
