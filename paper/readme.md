# publication about the FPGA-SoC control system

We have published a paper on describing the system and showing some measurements on [Review of Scientific Instruments](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/92/10/105103/960945/A-flexible-system-on-a-chip-control-hardware-for) about the control system. Here I provide a copy of the publication on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02889). 

In the [data folder](./data) there is the data for each figure (pdf and eps format) and a Python 3 analysis script which analyses the data and generates the figure (pdf). The same data can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/5145980).

In the [schematics folder](./schematics) there is the electronic schematics (pdf) of the circuit for generating and detecting the trigger pulses for the auto-synchronization.
