Here is the paper (arxiv submission version) describing the system and showing some measurements. 

In the data folder there is the data for each figure (csv format) and a Python 3 analysis script which analyses the data and generates the figure (pdf). The same data can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4893285

In the schematics folder there is the electronic schematics (pdf) of the circuit for generating and detecting the trigger pulses for the auto-synchronization.
